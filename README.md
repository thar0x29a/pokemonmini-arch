# pokemonmini-arch
pokemon mini architecture file for bass v14 and above

For now it is just messing around. I took the csv table from 
https://github.com/asterick/minimon.js/blob/master/tools/s1c88.csv and started to convert it.

Since im not really into PM right now it's unfinished as hell. But henche, I needed to store
my results somewhere so: here it is. 

WIP.
